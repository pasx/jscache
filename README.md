Simple Javascript Cache

I needed a spatial cache so created this simple base cache and derived class.
The comparison function can be overriden in derived class.
The desired numbed of records can be set, it is not a maximum and will be exceeded as checking the cache size and crunching is not done on every addition.
I have only checked basic add and get so far and not the crunching, this is still a work in progress. Please report any issues.
